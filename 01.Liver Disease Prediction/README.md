This repository contains the code and resources for a liver disease prediction project.

## Files

*   **`app.py`**: A Streamlit web application for liver disease prediction.  Users can input patient data, and the app will provide a prediction.
*   **`Liver Disease Prediction.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the dataset and the model training process.  This notebook documents the steps taken to build and evaluate the prediction model.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python packages required to run the project. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.

## Usage

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
3.  **Explore the Data and Model:** Open `Liver Disease Prediction.ipynb` in a Jupyter Notebook environment to review the data analysis and model building process.

# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using cosine similarity based on movie features.

## Overview

The system analyzes movie data (genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director) to identify similar movies based on user input. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical feature vectors and calculates cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies.


## Usage

1.  **Run the script.** Execute the Python script.

2.  **Enter your favorite movie.** When prompted, type the name of a movie you enjoy.

3.  **View recommendations.** The system will display a list of recommended movies based on the similarity of their feature vectors to your input movie.

# Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict food delivery times based on various factors.

## Overview

The model predicts delivery time based on:

* Delivery person's age
* Delivery person's rating
* Distance between the restaurant and the delivery location


## Data

The project utilizes a dataset (Food Delivery Time Prediction.xlsx) containing information about past deliveries, including the features listed above and the actual delivery time.

## Model

An LSTM model is trained on the provided dataset.  The model is saved as `model.sav` using `pickle`.

This repository contains the code and resources for a resume screening application built using Streamlit.  

## Project Structure

* **`app.py`**: The main Streamlit application file.  Run this to launch the  app.
* **`Resume Screening.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the model training process. This notebook demonstrates the steps involved in preparing the data and building the machine learning model used for resume screening.
* **`requirements.txt`**:  Lists the project's dependencies. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to set up the environment.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

This will launch the application in your web browser.


## Usage Instructions
